            <p>Hi, I'm Mike Torres, the technician and founder of FixItWorks. My passion for cars, motorcycles, and
                bikes has been a driving force in my life. I specialize in working on Land Rovers, BMW twin turbos,
                e-bikes, road bikes, and even 3D printers. Raised in Northern California, I have a deep love for yoga
                and playing guitar, which keeps me balanced and inspired. At FixItWorks, I bring my expertise and
                enthusiasm to every project, ensuring that everything is done right the first time.</p>
