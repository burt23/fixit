          Hi, I'm Mike, the technician and founder of FixItWorks. My passion for
          cars, motorcycles, and bikes has driven me toward learning to maintain
          and repair such vehicles. In doing so I've developed a great love for
          repairing things and giving them a second life. My current Land Rover,
          and former E93 n54 BMW twin turbo has given me a great love for both
          performance racing and 4x4 off road vehicles. Additionally I have a
          special affinity towards E-bikes, road bikes, and most obviously 3D
          printers. Raised in Northern California, I have a deep love for
          nature, yoga, guitar, cycling, and jiu-jitsu. At FixItWorks, I bring
          my passion and attention to detail to every project, ensuring we
          exceed customer expectations.
